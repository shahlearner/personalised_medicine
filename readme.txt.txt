About the Project:
This is another project as part of certification program at Edwisor.com.
The kaggle link of the project can be found here : https://www.kaggle.com/c/msk-redefining-cancer-treatment

Aim: Automatically classify genetic mutations that contribute to cancer tumor growth (so-called “drivers”) in the presence of mutations that don’t affect the tumors (“passengers”).

Problem Statement: A cancer tumor can have thousands of genetic mutations. But the challenge is to classify the mutations that contribute to tumor growth (drivers) from the neutral mutations (passengers). Currently this interpretation of genetic mutations is being done manually. This is a very time-consuming task where a clinical pathologist has to manually review and classify every single genetic mutation based on evidence from text-based clinical literature. In this project we are going to build a machine learning algorithm that using this knowledge base as a baseline, automatically classifies genetic variations. 


############################# Instructions to run the code #################

1. Place all the files in this repository in your current working directory
2. xyz are data files.
3. Run exploratory_part.R for data visualisation and insights.
4. The report file personalized_medicine_project.docx contains the analysis done during the course of the project.
5. Run final_code_change.R for data preparation and model building. The output accuracy is stored in predictions_result.xls
